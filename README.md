## 📂 Project Descriptions

### 🧠 Project 1 – Twitter Topic Classifier
I build a pipeline in python which trains BERT to classify 4 million tweets from politicians between 2010-2020 into 19 different topics.

### ⚙️ Project 2 – Causal Effect of High Tech Procurement on US Innovation
I estimated the causal effect of US military procurement spending during the Cold War on the formation of regional innovation clusters which persist until today.
